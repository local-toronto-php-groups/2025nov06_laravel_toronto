## 

Our meet-up last month ([https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/events/311407409/](https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/events/311407409/)) was the first one we've had that was about AI. 

A dozen Artisans gathered around Vetster's beautiful boardroom table, and spent a solid three hours talking about AI. 

We are continuing the discussion this month, at Maple's gorgeous downtown office. 

Schedule:
- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: AI+PHP+Laravel
