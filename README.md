## 

Our meet-up last month ([https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/events/311407409/](https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/events/311407409/)) was the first one we've had that was about AI. 

A dozen Artisans gathered around Vetster's beautiful boardroom table, and spent a solid three hours talking about AI. 

We are continuing the discussion this month, at Maple's gorgeous downtown office. 

Schedule:
- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: AI+PHP+Laravel

## 
I was mulling the question of who in our amazing PHP Community would be able to ask the wide ranging questions about AI that were posed at our October 16th meet-up. Someone who is familiar with the wide range of AI stuff. Someone who is not affiliated with any AI company or product, because we do not want to turn our meet-ups in to AI sales seminars. 

I could only think of one person: Povilas Korop. 

As luck would have it, in his recent newsletter, Povilas mentioned his speaking at local Groups. So, I reached out to him. His answer is "yes". However, he is unavailable for our November meet-up. I suggested that we send him questions, and that he responds with a pre-recorded video, that we will watch at the meet-up. 

Please send me your questions for Povilas via comments in meetup.com, email, and Discord.

If you have yet to subscribe to Povilas' free AI+PHP newsletter, I highly recommend that you do so at [https://substack.com/@aicodingdaily](https://substack.com/@aicodingdaily). 

I also highly recommend that you subscribe to his YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/@AICodingDaily](https://www.youtube.com/@AICodingDaily).
